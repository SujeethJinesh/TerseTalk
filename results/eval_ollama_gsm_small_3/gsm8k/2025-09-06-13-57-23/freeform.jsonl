{"answer": "No additional information is provided about how many months are in a year, so we can't calculate the exact amount of badges each character earns per year. However, if we assume that a full year has 12 months, then:\n- Claire earns 12 badges per year (since she earns 1 badge per month)\n- Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so it would take her 4 months to earn one badge on average. Therefore, Amanda would only earn 3 badges per year instead of Ashley's 10 badges per year. \n- Wendy earns three times as many badges per month as Claire because she can earn 1 badge every 2 minutes instead. Therefore, Wendy would be able to complete 24 months' worth of work in one year compared to Claire who can only complete 12 months, resulting in Wendy earning 18 times as many badges as Amber and Ashley combined for the same time period.\nSo, Wendy earns 9 more badges than Amber per month on average but in a full year would have significantly more badges than Amber due to her ability to work at three times the speed.\n\n\nHere's a little brain teaser!
